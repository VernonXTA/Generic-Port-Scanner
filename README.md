A simple and easy to understand Python script that scans a website / IP for open port connections. 
  There are two modes for this script: "Turbo" and "Casual"
  
Turbo mode uses multi-threading for faster scanning of open ports, however this is a more 'aggressive' scan type and is easily catchable.
Casual takes a slow but efficent time to find open ports.
